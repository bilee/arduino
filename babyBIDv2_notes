BID v2
I created BID project- press easy button (closet press light from Dollar store)and rgb led changes color;
V2, I want RGB led to constantly change color and then change again when pressed;

so theory is arduino PWM? sends signal to rgb variating color then same code as existing babyBID project applies.....
